    <h2>Day 3 - Wednesday July 10 2024</h2>
    <p>Today was all about the party so I don't have much to add.</p>
    <br />
    <h2><i>The Day of the Party</i></h2>
    <p>
      The pool party was very fun and I really enjoyed it because my classmates
      from school were there. Although they weren't my friends, it was still
      pretty fun playing different pool games in the water. After playing in the
      pool, we played <em>UNO</em> which was chaotic but very funny. Overall, I
      really liked this day because it was very fun and I get to see my
      classmates even though we are in the summer break.
