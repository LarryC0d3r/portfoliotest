      This is a blog about my week from July 8 to July 12 2024! I hope you like
      it!!!
    </p>
    <h2>Day 1 - Monday July 8 2024</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing I did was wake up at 6:30 in the morning and started to do
      my morning routine. My morning routine goes as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wake up.</li>
      <li>Brush my Teeth.</li>
      <li>Take a Bath.</li>
      <li>Change into clothes.</li>
      <li>Dryed my hair.</li>
      <li>Combed my hair.</li>
      <li>Eat Breakfast.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h2>Breakfast</h2>
    <p>
      What I ate for breakfast was porridge with salted eggs. If you don't know
      what <b>salted eggs</b> are, then here is a picture!

    <h2>Getting a Haircut!</h2>
    <p>
      Another thing that I did on this day was getting a haircut. I usually
      don't like haircuts and I always will and fun fact, I never liked my
      cutting my hair ever since I was little!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Eating Sushi!</h2>
    <p>
      After taking my haircut, I went to go eat sushi with my family. The
      restaurant is a Japanese restaurant that sells different types of food. If
      you really like sushi or other Japanese food, then you should come there!
      Tip: Book a reservation before you go because it is full of people.
