    <h2>Day 4 - Thursday July 11 2024</h2>
    <p>This time I actually did barely did anything but here is what I have.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Waking Up Late</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      When I woke up, I hear the sound of my little brother waking me up at 9:30
      in the morning. I don't usually wake up <b>THAT</b> late even though I
      slept at 10:00pm. After that, I decided to do my little brother's morning
      routine for him such as,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give him a bottle of milk</li>
      <li>Take him to the potty</li>
      <li>Shower for him</li>
      <li>Brush his teeth</li>
      <li>Wear his clothes for him</li>
    </ul>
