    <h2>Playing with Cousins</h2>
    <p>
      Today I got to play with my two younger cousins from my mum's side. We had
      to pick them up from their house and bring them to my house. After that,
      we played different games and activities throughout the day.

    <h2>What I had for Lunch</h2>
    <p>
      After playing with them, we ate lunch. We had pasta with soup and some
      ground beef. It kind of tasted plain but it was yummy.

    <h2>Riding Bicycle</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we rode our bicycles around the street. It was very fun to ride
      bicycles but my little brother fell off the bicycle so we stopped riding
      it.
