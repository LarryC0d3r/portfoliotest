    <h2>Eating Pepper Lunch for Lunch</h2>
    <p>
      After swimming, my mum, my little brother, and I went to
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kALokQMN66REPPWd7">AEON Sen Sok City</a>
      to eat Pepper Lunch. It is on the 2nd floor next to this restaurant called
      'Bijin Nabe'. The food was very yummy but I burned my tongue because I
      wasn't careful.

    <h2>Going Grocery Shopping for a Party</h2>
    <p>
      After lunch, we went shopping for groceries for a pool party which was for
      tomorrow. The things we had to bring to the party was fruits for the other
      guests at the party for someone. My mum bought many different types of
      fruit such as, oranges, strawberries, cherries and so many more.
